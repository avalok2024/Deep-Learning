## Diabetes and Not Diabetes
Here we are making the Machine Learning Project for Healthcare. 

### Workflow 
first we take diabetes data which contain the data of
BMI, Blood Pressure etc.
here we use the standard scaler for pre-processing, Then we will use model selection for train
test split then we will upload in **Support Vector Machine Classifier**.

in Support Vector Machine Classifier is Binary Classifier which gives the answer only in 0/1. 

And we will use the metrics for finding the accuracy score for how it is predictable?

After train the Classifier we will use New data and upload to the trained model & it will predict the output.
